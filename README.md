This folder contains a sample problem with several files and folders.

**inputs** and **outputs** folders are pretty self explanatory. minimum of 20 test cases
is a must have for a problem. if the problem expects more than one test case to
be solved at one run, the inputs can be different combinations of a small set of
test cases.

**solv** folder is supposed to contain a solver for the problem in some
accesible programming language. this is a must have as well.

**gen** folder is supposed to contain an input file generator if it's possible.

**statement.md** is a text file in the markdown format. look inside it
for basic usage, and see [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
for an in depth tutorial of markdown.

**notes.md** is the place to put your notes for the contest organizator that
might be helpful before, after and during the contest especially for this problem.

###Some notes
- output for a given input must always be the same. explicitly stating that some 
  sort of ordering is required in the output might be useful.
