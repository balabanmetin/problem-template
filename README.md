This folder contains a sample problem with 4 folders and a file for the problem
statement.  

**inputs** and **outputs** folders are pretty self explanatory. minimum of 20 test cases
is a must have for a problem. if the problem expects more than one test case to
be solved at one run, the inputs can be different combinations of a small set of
test cases.

**solv** folder is supposed to contain a solver for the problem in some
accesible programming language. this is a must have as well.

**gen** folder is supposed to contain an input file generator if it's possible.

and the file **statement.md** is a text file in the markdown format. look inside it
for basic usage, and see [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
for an in depth tutorial of markdown.
